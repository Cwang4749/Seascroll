Name: Sea_Scroll
Tested/Deployed : For Android only 

Concept/Idea of App:
There are scrolls present and each scroll has messages written in them.  
A user can create a scroll with a message inside it or write a message into a existing scroll. 
Also the messages are written by other anonymous users.
The gimmick of the app is that once a user writes a message, the scroll is tossed into the ocean so a different user can see it. 
But that other user does not know who wrote that message. There is a mystery element to our app. 
Users of the app can play a game in real life with their friends about guessing who wrote what message. That is just a suggestion from the creators of the app.

__**IMPORTANT*__: The original firebase and GCP projects that were tied to this project are no longer active. Therefore if cloning this project, one must create their own Firebase and GCP connections.
